mkdldir
=======

This script was broken down into two more generic ones that can be used for
generating a private download directory with Apache HTTPd like this script
used to do:

* [mkadindex](https://github.com/remino/mkadindex)
* [mkdigauth](https://github.com/remino/mkdigauth)

There is also a new script with accompanying template repo:

* [dldirs](https://github.com/remino/dldirs)
